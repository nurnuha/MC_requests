# MC_requests

Monte Carlo requests for charm physics analyses

This repository contains setup to prepare and test locally the MC requests for charm analyses at 7, 5 and 0.9 TeV. 

The codes (CmsDriv.py and CmsRun.sh) have been created by me to make the local test easier for this purpose. It is based on the template from B-Physics group [1].
